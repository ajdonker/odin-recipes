    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers wide, flat pasta sheets with a rich combination of fillings, typically including a hearty meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and gooey melted cheese. The pasta sheets are first boiled until al dente and then layered with a sauce made from ground beef or sausage, onions, garlic, and tomatoes simmered to perfection. Each layer of pasta is generously spread with the meat sauce, followed by a creamy béchamel or ricotta mixture, and a sprinkling of mozzarella or Parmesan cheese. This process is repeated until the dish is fully assembled, usually ending with a final layer of cheese that bubbles and browns to create a golden crust when baked.</p>
    <p>The beauty of lasagna lies in its versatility. While the traditional version often features a meat-based sauce, variations abound, from vegetarian lasagna with layers of roasted vegetables and spinach to seafood lasagna featuring shrimp and crab. The dish can be customized with different types of cheeses, sauces, and fillings, making it a favorite for gatherings and family dinners. After baking, the lasagna rests briefly to allow the layers to set, making it easier to slice and serve. Each bite offers a harmonious blend of flavors and textures, from the tender pasta to the savory sauce and creamy cheese, making lasagna a comforting and satisfying meal.
